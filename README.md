Overview
Major focus on commonly used machine learning algorithms
Algorithms covered- Linear regression, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, kNN, Random forest, etc.
Learn both theory and implementation of these algorithms in python


I am providing a high level understanding about various machine learning algorithms along Python codes to run them. These should be sufficient to get your hands dirty.
